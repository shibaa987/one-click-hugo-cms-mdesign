Whatever name you know it by—Mehndi, Mehendi, or Mehandi—it all refers to the same thing. Please don't be confused because I may use a variety of terminology in my works in the future.

The Sanskrit term mehndika, which is commonly derived from the herb henna, is where the name mehndi originates. Not only on human skin but also on clothing, documents, and other surfaces, henna leaves are known to leave stains wherever they are applied.

However, because this hue has a natural effect on materials and is also healthy and excellent for the human body, it has been utilised to create temporary body art, or mehndi design.

When written in Hindi, it sounds exactly the same, however some people also write it as "mehendi design" or "mehandi design" when they write it in English. If you read it, it all sounds the same, but the differences in writing are what make them sound different.

[The introduction to Mehendi design](https://mehndidesign.io/) that has been provided thus far is quite brief. The fact that it has so many more positive effects on the human body is another important factor in why individuals choose to utilise it. In the upcoming parts, I will elaborate further on this. I'll also write about the many Mehendi patterns that are applied all throughout the world.
